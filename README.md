This experience reinforced my ability to handle practical, commercial, and technical demands in the IT field, in addition to strengthening my performance in corporate environments.
## 2020 – 2021
I worked at Nosso Atacarejo, where I was responsible for the installation and maintenance of servers, racks, and software. I also provided technical support for microcomputers and participated directly in the implementation of network infrastructure in affiliates, ensuring connectivity and operational efficiency. Additionally, I performed database and system monitoring, and installed NVR and DVR security cameras, ensuring data stability and protection for the company.
## 2008
I expanded my work as a teaching assistant at Instituto Gurilândia, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. There, I provided technical support to the school and participated in the maintenance of systems and equipment. This phase was essential for consolidating my commitment to technology applied to education and the improvement of learning environments.
